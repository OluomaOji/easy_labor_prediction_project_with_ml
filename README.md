#  Easy Labor Prediction with Machine Learning

OFLC has hired You as a data scientist to analyse the data provided, and come up with insights that will be helpful in making data-driven decisions to; Facilitate the process of H1-visa approvals. Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.

A machine learning-powered API that predicts the likelihood of being approved for an H1-visa. Built with **FastAPI**, containerized using **Docker**, and designed for deployment to the cloud.
